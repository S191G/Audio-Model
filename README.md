# Audio-Model
This audio model is to classify the samples of audio 
which i had just used only two kind of samples like one is just background noise and another one is whistle 
so within these the samples will be colected randomly and trained the model and finally when the model is trained the inputs are given 
So then the model will give the output w.r.t the input we had given.
This is just a model from Teach Machines from web which was collaborated with IBM and suggested by the IBM course which is AI Foundations , which I am doing right now.
